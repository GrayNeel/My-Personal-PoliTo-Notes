## Disclaimer
All the published notes are NOT officially. This means that they are NOT verified or reviewed in any way by any Professor of Politecnico. For this reason, use them carefully as I am not responsible for any mistake that these notes may contain. 
Since this material is coming from lessons of Politecnico you have no rights to sell them since the contents are not copyright-free.
Furthermore, to use them you have to be currently enrolled at Politecnico.

## Who am I?
If you are a student of Computer Engineering @ Politecnico di Torino you probably already used some of my notes for your studies. I am that guy which made notes for the principal courses of Politecnico and that published all of them in the Telegram Groups of the courses.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to manage all my notes so that you can find all of them in one single places. Furthermore, you can find here the source files so that you can personalize and update them (If you pull request some updates i will appreciate).

## Bachelor

### Chimica
This is my first file about notes in Politecnico. It is a brief recap of the main arguments plus a formulary. Definitely not sufficient to pass the exam, but may help during your recap.
### Teoria ed elaborazione dei segnali
Just a formulary of all the stuff that you may find in your exam.
### Fisica I
This is a resume of the "Mazzoldi, Nigro, Voci - Fisica 1" book. So these notes do not come from any Professor of Politecnico and it may be helpful after your lessons.
### Reti di Calcolatori
This is the full recap of all the arguments. I personally studied from here to pass my exam.
### Sistemi Operativi
This is the full recap of all the arguments. I personally studied from here to pass my exam.
## Master

### Tecnologie e Servizi di Rete
This is the full recap of all the arguments. I personally studied from here to pass my exam. Some arguments are not so clear so I suggest you to watch lessons too.
### Information Systems Security
This is the full recap of all the arguments. I personally studied from here to pass my exam.
### Cybersecurity
This is the full recap of all the arguments. I personally studied from here to pass my exam.
### Security Verification and Testing
I'm working on it (June 2022) so it still UNPUBLISHED. Will update this repository soon or later with the full notes of this course. If you want to help text me on Telegram @GrayNeel
